# PrestaShop Auto-Completion

This is a package that provides auto-completion for PrestaShop modules, controllers, hooks, constants ...

If you are like me and are developing PrestaShop modules in your IDE without including the whole PrestaShop project
folder, you will find this package very helpful.

# Installation

Via Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev "debuss-a/prestashop-autocompletion"
```

# Usage

After installing the package, your IDE will automatically detect the classes and constants provided by this package.  
You can start using them in your code without any additional configuration.
